# Given two binary numbers represented as stringd, return the sume of the two binay numbers as a
# a new binary represented as a string. Do this without converting
# the whole binary string into an integer.

# Here's an example and some starter code.

def sum_binary(bin1, bin2):

    # Fill this in.

    # 1. convert the binary numbers to decimal numbers  
    # 2. add the decimal numbers together
    # 3. convert the sum of the decimal numbers to a binary number
    # 4. return the binary number as a string
    # 5. do this without converting the whole binary string into an integer
    # 6. do this without converting the whole binary string into a decimal number 
    # 7. do this without converting the whole binary string into a binary number

# print(sum_binary("11101", "1011"))
# 101000
